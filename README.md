## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- ~~Load and familiarize yourself with the dataset.~~
- ~~Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the variables.~~
- Visualize the correlations between different characteristics and the outcomes for the animals.

## 2. Data Pre-processing:
- ~~Clean the data, handling missing values and categorical variables.~~
- ~~Convert categorial values to numerical ones~~
- Normalize or standardize the data as necessary (use sklearn.preprocessing MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler on 'AgeuponOutcome').
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## 3. Modeling:
- Choose and justify the machine learning model(s) you will use to predict the outcomes for the animals.
- Train the model(s) using the training set.
- Evaluate the performance of the model(s) using the testing set. Use appropriate metrics for classification problems, such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## 4. Results Interpretation:
- Analyze the obtained results and discuss the performance of the model(s).
- Identify the most important characteristics that influence the predictions.
